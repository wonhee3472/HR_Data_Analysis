# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Pewlett-Hackard is a huge company with severeal thousands of employees and it's been around for a long time. As the baby boomer generation begins to retire at rapid rate, the company is preparing itself by doing two things: 1. it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria; 2. it's starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in a near future. 

The number of upcoming retirements will open up thousand of job openings. Bobby, a HR analyst for the company, is tasked to perform employee research. First, he needs to find out who will be retiring in the next few years. And next, he needs to know how many positions will the company have to fill. 

For this specific project, I'm going to be helping Bobby to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

The table indicates that there will be a great need to hire more engineers at the same or similar level of experience or promote the junior engineers internally since almost 26,000 senior engineers are retiring. Also, since there will be 10,000 engineers retiring (9,285 engineers and 1,090 assistance engineers), the company will definitely have to alert the HR department that they will need to reach outwardly to get the talents.

## Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
